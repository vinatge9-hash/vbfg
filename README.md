# Paw & Tail Dog Care Website

This is a complete 3-page dog care website built with Tailwind CSS (via CDN) and semantic HTML. It uses a single-category, friendly/approachable design approach suitable for a dog care business offering services like dog walking, grooming, and overnight boarding.

File structure:
- index.html — Home page with hero, services, and overview
- about.html — About page with team/story
- contact.html — Contact form and contact details
- README.md — This documentation

How to run:
- Open the three HTML files directly in a browser. No server is required.

Notes:
- All styling is done with Tailwind utility classes (no separate CSS files).
- Images are inserted as placeholders using the format {{image: description }}. Replace with real images as needed.
- The hero sections use a background image placeholder with a dark overlay for readability.

Customization suggestions:
- Update background images to match your brand.
- Update content in Home/About/Contact pages to reflect your services and policies.
- Replace placeholder images with real photography of your dogs/ facilities.
- Adjust color scheme and typography to align with your branding.
